Pokedex is our second mini project for our training program for Mobile Developers of Berkeley. This application features a functioning Pokedex that lists presents Pokemon in tables, including all their stats in presentable formats through raw JSON data. Users can obtain info about any Pokemon through a search functionality. They can also add Pokemon to their "Favorite Pokemon List", which is presented in a Tab Bar Controller. Compatible with iPhone X and later**
